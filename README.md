[jQuery Event Filter](http://www.codenothing.com/archives/jquery/event-filter/)
========================

Filter elements based on the events attached to them.


Bowser Support
--------------

**IE** Still needs testing  
**FireFox** 3.6  
**Safari** 4.0.5  
**Opera** 10.10  
**Chrome** 5.0  


Live Events
-----------
This plugin does not support live event filtering. This includes events attached using the delegate method. These events
are attached to elements higher up the DOM tree above the target elements, essentially leaving the target elements eventless.
